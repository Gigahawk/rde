* Description of NixOS setup x1 carbon 5th 2017
** Lenovo Thinkpad x1 carbon 5th
*** Introduction
I have this machine and want to share my experience installing NixOS on it. I'm
a gnu/linux guy since 2004, but it is my first attempt to work with this
distribution. After few weeks I'm still happy that I tried it. 

Model: 20HRX004US i7-7600u, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd

*** Downsides
- Most annoying thing that it is become hot very easily (as most ultrabooks),
keyboard still ok and it is not a real problem when you don't put laptop on your
knees.
- It has a coil noise, but it's not loud and appears rarely (dell xps 13
has extremly awful coil whine and in compare with it, x1 carbon is silent).
- Once in few hours I can't move cursors for few seconds.

In case I find any other issues will try to update this section.
** Goals
| Features to implement  | Implemented  |
|------------------------+--------------|
| Encrypted root         | +            |
| Power saving           | +            |
| USB-C dockstation      | +            |
| WWAN                   | to be done   |
| Fingerprint reader     | - for now    |
| Custom keyboard layout | later        |
| Awesome window manager | another file |
** Prepare bootable usb stick
- Download NixOS [[https://nixos.org/nixos/download.html][iso]] image
- Write it on usb stick using [[https://unetbootin.github.io/][unetbootin]]
- Change label of your usb stick to ~NIXOS_ISO~, without it you can occur some
  issues when booting from usb
- Reboot to BIOS setup: disable secure boot, enable CSM
- Boot your live operating system
- ~systemctl start display-manager~
  
** Setup encrypted root
Take a look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification][article]] about SSDs.

Resize or remove unnecessary partitions using gdisk or gparted, but keep in
mind that EFI system partition is required, create it or keep existing one. 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ gdisk /dev/sda
#+END_SRC

- o (create new empty partition table if necessary)
- n (add partition if necessary, 500M, type ef00 EFI)
- n (add partition, as big as you want, 300G, type 8300 Linux LVM)
- w (write partition table and exit)
  
Suppose your big partition is /dev/sda2, your EFI system partition is /dev/sda1.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
man cryptsetup lvm
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda2
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 lvmroot
# Init as lvm partition
pvcreate /dev/mapper/lvmroot
# Add volume group and root/swap partitions
vgcreate vg /dev/mapper/lvmroot
lvcreate -L 16G -n swap vg
lvcreate -l '100%FREE' -n root vg
# Init filesystems on partitions
mkfs.fat /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/vg/root
mkswap -L swap /dev/vg/swap
#+END_SRC

** Install NixOS
Mount all things.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mount /dev/vg/root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
swapon /dev/vg/swap
#+END_SRC

Connect to wifi somehow. It's pretty easy if you use image mentioned above.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
blkid /dev/sda5
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
configuration.nix here
configuration-hardware.nix here
nixos-install
#+END_SRC

* WWAN

My carbon doesn't have a WWAN module inside, but it's possible to buy and
install it. There are some problems: NOWWAN version of carbon doesn't have
antennas installed, also there are many different modems across the network and
all have different costs. I went hard way and bought cheapest [[https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Wireless-EM7455-LTE-4G-NGFF-Module-DW5811E-3P10Y-300-M-para-E7270-E7470-E7370-E5570-Sem/32802126649.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.PPPHcB][one]] and updated
firmware (it's a little bit tricky). Antennas (not native) included in the
package, work good enough, but installation requires patience and savvy. Cabel
routing isn't easy, but can be done pretty accurate.

If you don't want to update firmware and afraid of installing non-native
antennas you can find original parts, they can be easily installed and will work
out of the box.

You can't boot with modem, which has firmware different from original, cause
modem with "wrong" vendor and product ids (413c and 81b6) can't pass whitelist
checks. But you can boot your OS and put your laptop to sleep, after that
install a modem and voila, it works, but after reboot problem with whitelist
will arise again. That is why it is necessary update firmware in case you buy
"cheap" modem.

After installation of modem and resuming from sleep dmesg shows following lines:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash

You need two files to update firmware:
SWI9X30C_02.05.07.00.cwe and 1102662_9905046_EM7455_02.05.07.00_00_Lenovo-Laptop_001.003_000.nvu

This files can be googled or found in
https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/r07ws07w.exe, maybe it will be
necessary to work with 7z or similar tool to get them from this file.
After you found them run two commands, first one is optional and needed only in rare cases:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#sudo qmi-firmware-update -b -d 413c:81b6
sudo qmi-firmware-update -u -d 413c:81b6 --device-open-mbim SWI9X30C_02.05.07.00.cwe 1102662_9905046_EM7455_02.05.07.00_00_Lenovo-Laptop_001.003_000.nvu
#+END_SRC

After firmware update you should get following lines (or very similar) in your dmesg.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
