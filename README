*Disclaimer:* currently this is a proof of concept project.

*Tip:* older Nix source code is available under ~stale/~ directory.

Set of tools for managing computing environments with GNU Guix.
** Principles
- Ergonomic :: Sane keybindings, good contrast, readable fonts.
- Reproducible :: Setup can be easily replicated.
- Hackable :: Easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
- Stateless :: All state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
