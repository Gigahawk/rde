* rde
Set of tools for managing computing environments.
** Principles
- Comfortable :: good contrast, readable fonts.
- Reproducible :: setup can be easily replicated.
- Hackable :: easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
- Stateless :: all state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
* src content
- modules :: small configuration for one or few packages
- profiles :: collection of modules
- hosts :: combination of profiles and modules

* Directories and partitions [WIP]
